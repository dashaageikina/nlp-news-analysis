# NYT Topic Classifier ðŸ“°

This NLP project classifies New York Times front-page articles by topic using machine learning models. 

A smaller labeled dataset (with article titles and small summaries) from the [Comparative Agendas Project](https://www.comparativeagendas.net) is used to train topic classification models. The trained model is then applied to a larger unlabeled NYT dataset containing front-page titles and abstracts.
